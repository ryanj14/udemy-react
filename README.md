Hey, this is my repository where I learned the fundementals of React.js and Redux.

The ui was done using the semantic ui.

The projects:

- jsx: This is just a simple app where I learned about the jsx basics

- components: This is another simple app where I learned about components

- pics : This is where I start to learn about API calls and class based components.
I've used axios to handle the API calls.

- songs: This app I learned how to implement the Redux and states.

- blog: Continue to nail down the knowledge of Redux.

- hooks-simple: This is where I learn about hooks and how it works with function based components.

- seasons: More hook related.

- translate: This is where I learned about the context system.

- streams: This is where I learned how to put together a simple streaming site.
This use Google Oauth for signin, an api to store different stream info, and a rtmp server.
The rtmp server takes the streaming from the user and converts it to a flash based video feed to the viewer.
This was create by a third party and I merely implemented it.
